I'm a software engineer by day and a games enthusiast by night living in San Francisco, CA.

I've been [playing video games](https://liquipedia.net/starcraft2/Pyre) my entire life and one day I decided it would be cool to make them in my spare time.

So far I've only made small [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam) games but I've learned a lot from those games such as [frame rate independence](https://pyrecraft.itch.io/retrorunner/devlog/79983/retro-runner-is-now-frame-rate-independent), [using gifs to increase click-through rates](https://pyrecraft.itch.io/mined-mind/devlog/93492/using-gifs-to-increase-conversion-rates), and [animating characters via primitive shapes](https://pyrecraft.itch.io/hops-and-harmony/devlog/112833/cute-animation-with-primitive-shapes) just to name a few.

I got my first ever fan-created [youtube Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1XVzD1UGBs) of one of my games, a few donations, and most importantly.. a [shoutout from Lucas Pope!!](https://twitter.com/dukope/status/1166685572003352576)

I still have a toooon of learning to do and a lot more games to create but I'm looking forward to the process because I'm having so much fun. You can find my games [here](https://pyrecraft.itch.io/) and my music [here](https://soundcloud.com/pyrecraft). I also have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/pyrecraft) which I post updates to occasionally ^^
